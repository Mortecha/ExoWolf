Reddikopter -> Thessalikopter -> Thalassikopter

The year is 2080, you thought human technologies would make billions of cities on earth decorated with neon light by 2070s. But for decades, technologies only enables more digital surveillance done by people in power that surpress people's freedom to innovate. Forget technology, like, for real. Forget about anything you do for a while and take a look at our earth. We've been too focused with hundreds of problems here and there, accros the globe, but forget about our earth.

In 2078, Antarctica has only 40% ice left from what it has 5 decades ago. Sea level starts raising years ago. And today, thousands of cities accros the earth continue to be sunken to the ocean. Or rather, ocean comes to us.

You can't do a massive contribution to the world, nobody can. But you have your helicopter with special technology: an electric helicopter powered by the sun. You can help evacuate people from the ocean to the safe places.
