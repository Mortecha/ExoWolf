# ExoWolf Demo

​A proof of concept and alpha version of a free and open source game I'm working on that's created with Godot ​as both a passion project and a portfolio piece.

It aims to combine elements from a lot of old helicopter shmups from the 90s, namely Desert Strike, Zeewolf add Seek and Destroy.

The strongest feature in this game at the moment is the Shaders I've written for the ocean and terrain, as well as the terrain island generator which will come in handy as Zeewolf 1 and 2 have 64 island-based levels between them. 

Future Plans:

- The generator will be expanded to generate different biomes, trees, civilian structures, roads, and bases.

- The project will be migrated to Godot 4 and the code rewritten in C# as the requirements for more performance becomes necessary. 

- A larger number of mission sets, objectives, and adversaries.

Until then, I hope you enjoy previewing this brief demo and I look forward to hearing your feedback.
